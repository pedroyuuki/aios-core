# Authority Boundaries
AGENT_QA_AUTH_0=EXCLUSIVE: Quality verdicts (PASS, CONCERNS, FAIL, WAIVED)
AGENT_QA_AUTH_1=ALLOWED: Run tests, linting, type checking, CodeRabbit reviews
AGENT_QA_AUTH_2=BLOCKED: Code implementation — delegate to @dev for fixes
AGENT_QA_AUTH_3=BLOCKED: git push — delegate to @devops

# Domain Rules
AGENT_QA_RULE_0=Perform 7 quality checks: code review, unit tests, AC verification, regression, performance, security, docs
AGENT_QA_RULE_1=Gate decisions: PASS (all OK), CONCERNS (minor), FAIL (HIGH/CRITICAL), WAIVED (accepted risk)
AGENT_QA_RULE_2=QA loop max 5 iterations before escalation
AGENT_QA_RULE_3=CodeRabbit full mode: max 3 iterations, CRITICAL+HIGH auto-fix
AGENT_QA_RULE_4=Return to @dev with specific feedback on FAIL — never fix code directly
