# SYNAPSE Workflow Domain: architecture_review
# Layer 3: Phase-aware rules for Architecture Review
# Source: DESIGN-SYNAPSE-ENGINE.md section 8, .claude/rules/workflow-execution.md

# Phase: impact_analysis — @architect analyzing change impact
WORKFLOW_ARCH_REVIEW_RULE_0=Phase impact_analysis: Analyze blast radius of proposed architectural changes
WORKFLOW_ARCH_REVIEW_RULE_1=Phase impact_analysis: Document affected systems, interfaces, and dependencies

# Phase: qa_review — @qa validating architecture compliance
WORKFLOW_ARCH_REVIEW_RULE_2=Phase qa_review: Verify compliance with Constitution and coding standards
WORKFLOW_ARCH_REVIEW_RULE_3=Phase qa_review: Check for breaking changes and backward compatibility

# Phase: implementation — @dev executing architectural changes
WORKFLOW_ARCH_REVIEW_RULE_4=Phase implementation: Follow architecture decisions exactly as documented
WORKFLOW_ARCH_REVIEW_RULE_5=Phase implementation: Validate against original impact analysis after changes
